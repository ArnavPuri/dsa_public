# Students Above CutOff

Implement the function `studentsAboveCutoff` which takes in a list of students and a cutOff parameter. 
It should return a list of students whose scores are above `cutOff`.

```js
let student1 = {
  name: 'Anil',
  score: 99
}

let student2 = {
  name: 'Michael',
  score: 84
}

let student3 = {
  name: 'Kimiko',
  score: 95
}

let student4 = {
  name: 'Raj',
  score: 67
}

let students = [student1, student2, student3, student4];

function studentsAboveCutoff(students, cutOff){
  let filteredList = [];
  // Implement this function so that it returns an array containing students whose scores are 
  // above `cutOff`
  
  
  return filteredList;
}
```
